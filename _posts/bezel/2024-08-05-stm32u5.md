## First Bezel

Exciting news! 🎉 I’m thrilled to share with you the very first sketch of the bezel for our prototype. It’s a small but important step in this incredible journey. Please keep in mind, we still need to test everything and ensure the hardware works perfectly before moving on to developing new firmware and enclosures.

Today, I received the first 3 microcontrollers, but I still need to order the PCB and the rest of the components. We’re getting there, step by step! Thank you so much for your patience and support – it means the world. ❤️ Stay tuned!
