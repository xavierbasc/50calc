At its core, the DM50 is driven by a mighty ARM Cortex-M33 chip, ensuring you get ultra-low power consumption without sacrificing performance. It’s got a math coprocessor and a Floating Point Unit, which means calculations are not just fast but blazing fast.

One of the standout features is the stunning LCD display. With a resolution of 128x64 dots, your calculations will be crystal clear. Whether you're crunching numbers or graphing functions, the display is designed to make your life easier and your work more enjoyable.

Powering the DM50 is a 3.7V rechargeable LiPO battery, ensuring you're always ready to go. But if you ever find yourself in a pinch, you can also pop in some AAA batteries. The USB-C port makes connecting to other devices a breeze, and it even has LED indicators for power and charging status. Add to that a sound buzzer and a temperature sensor, and you’ve got a gadget that’s as versatile as it is powerful.

Design-wise, the DM50 is a marvel. It’s been crafted with precision using FreeCAD software to ensure it’s compact and user-friendly. The customizable faceplate is a nice touch, allowing you to print your own design and give your calculator a personal flair.

Compared to its predecessors, the DM50 is lightyears ahead. It retains the beloved features of classic models like the HP48 but elevates the experience with modern tech and a sleek design. Whether you’re a student, a professional, or just a calculator enthusiast, the DM50 is set to become your new favorite tool.
