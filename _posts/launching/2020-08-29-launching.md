## Launching a New Open Source Classic Calculator Project

In the era of smartphones and digital apps, the charm and reliability of classic physical calculators like the HP42, HP48, and HP50 remain unmatched for many enthusiasts and professionals. Today, we are excited to announce the beginning of an ambitious project: the creation of a new, open-source physical calculator inspired by these iconic models. This project is designed for everyone, from seasoned engineers to DIY hobbyists, with all designs and plans freely available for download, improvement, and collaboration.

### Project Vision

Our vision is to combine the best of both worlds: the robustness and precision of classic calculators with the innovation and accessibility of modern technology. By leveraging open-source principles, we aim to create a calculator that not only pays homage to the past but also invites the community to contribute and evolve the design. This project will result in a device that is not only functional but also customizable, repairable, and manufacturable by anyone with the passion and tools to do so.

### Key Features

**New Hardware, Classic Feel**: The calculator will feature state-of-the-art hardware, ensuring longevity and performance, while maintaining the tactile and visual appeal of the classic models.
   
**Completely Open Source**: All aspects of the calculator, from the circuit board schematics to the firmware and case designs, will be open source. This allows anyone to download, modify, and share their improvements, fostering a collaborative development environment.

**DIY Friendly**: Designed with the DIY enthusiast in mind, the calculator can be assembled at home. Detailed assembly guides and component lists will be provided, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced makers.

**High-Quality 3D Printed Case**: The calculator’s case will be designed for 3D printing using SLA technology and a special ABS-like resin, ensuring a professional finish and durability. The design files will be available for free, allowing anyone to print their own case or customize it to their liking.

### Community Collaboration

We believe that the best products come from collective intelligence and diverse perspectives. To facilitate this, we will host our project on popular open-source platforms, where community members can contribute to the code, suggest hardware improvements, or share their own custom case designs. Regular updates and a forum for discussion will keep everyone informed and engaged.

### Getting Started

To get started, we will release the initial design files and a detailed project roadmap. Early adopters and contributors can begin by reviewing the plans, providing feedback, and participating in initial discussions. We also plan to launch a crowdfunding campaign to support the initial production run and gather funds for further development.

### Conclusion

This project is more than just a calculator; it’s a movement towards a more open, collaborative, and sustainable approach to technology. By bringing together a community of like-minded individuals, we aim to create a device that is not only useful but also a testament to what can be achieved when we work together. Join us on this exciting journey to reinvent the classic calculator for a new generation.

Stay tuned for updates, and we look forward to your contributions and support in making this vision a reality.
