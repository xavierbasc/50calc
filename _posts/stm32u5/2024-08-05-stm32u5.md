## Introducing the STM32U545 Processor

The STM32 family of microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics is based on ARM Cortex-M cores. In 2021, STMicroelectronics launched the new STM32U5 line of ultra-low-power microcontrollers based on the ARM Cortex-M33 core. With suitable clock frequency and computing power, they are ideal for use in next-generation calculators.

The STM32U5 family features Cortex-M33 cores built with a 40nm lithography, 32-bit architecture, and a maximum CPU frequency of 160 MHz. Some calculators that use the STM32 family as their main core include those manufactured by SwissMicros (DM42, DM41X, DM32, etc.).

For the design of the DM50 calculator, we have chosen the STM32U545CET6Q model, featuring a 48-pin LQFP package with the following main characteristics:

- **CPU Bits**: 32
- **Clock Frequency**: 160MHz
- **FLASH Memory (program)**: 512KB
- **RAM Memory**: 274KB
- **Power Consumption**: 90 nA when off, 16.3 Î¼A/MHz when on

### Memory Map

- **0x0000 0000 - 0x07FF FFFF (128MB)**: External memory (program)
- **0x0800 0000 - 0x0FFF FFFF (128MB)**: FLASH and RAM (program)
- **0x1000 0000 - 0x1FFF FFFF (256MB)**: External memory (program)
- **0x2000 0000 - 0x3FFF FFFF (512MB)**: RAM
- **0x4000 0000 - 0x5FFF FFFF (512MB)**: Peripherals
- **0x6000 0000 - 0xDFFF FFFF (2GB)**: External memory

### Boot Configuration

- **BOOT0 = 0**: 0x0800 0000 (FLASH)
- **BOOT0 = 1**: 0x0BF9 0000 (External memory)
