# Heart of the DM50 
The software is the heart and soul of any calculator, and its development demands meticulous attention to achieve maximum efficiency and quality.

I envision creating a foundation that inspires enthusiasts of calculators and other devices alike.

To foster rapid development and encourage contributions from everyone, regardless of whether they have a physical calculator, I propose developing desktop and mobile applications using the same core. This will accelerate the development and improvement of the calculator's software, making it accessible to a wider audience.

## Architecture

The philosophy is simple: the software will be divided into three parts:

1. **Operating System**: This will handle user interactions, such as key presses, sound, and screen management (initialization, clearing, drawing lines and points), as well as file management. It will provide a header file (.h) linking to system functions for program development. Two system versions will exist:
    - **(1) Desktop and mobile application**: These will require an additional graphical user interface layer to display the screen, keyboard, etc.
    - **(2) Firmware version (with STM32 MCU)**: This will be a binary portion without a presentation layer.

4. **(3) Programs**: The first program will be the calculator itself, which will rely on the operating system for execution, linked through the aforementioned header files.

## Platforms

Ultimately, the goal is to have the DM50 calculator available on the following platforms:

- DM50 hardware calculator
- Windows application
- macOS application
- Linux application
- iOS application (iPhone, iPad)
- Android application

I've noticed a growing interest among calculator enthusiasts, and we share the disappointment of seeing major manufacturers discontinue high-end calculators. However, I believe we can fill this void with open-source projects like this one. I encourage everyone to participate and enjoy the process.

The initial compiled and executable versions for diverse platforms will soon be available for download.

Best regards.
